            <p>The MyFlix app is a movie discovery and management platform for movie lovers. It allows users to register, log in, browse movies, and manage their favorite movie lists. The app provides a seamless user experience by offering features like creating user profiles, adding movies to a favorites list, and storing personal preferences like date of birth and email.</p>
            <p>This case study explores the key problems the app solves, the design approach I took to build it, and how I used modern technologies to solve those problems in an intuitive, user-friendly way.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">The Issue I will address with this app</h2>
            <p>Before MyFlix, many movie enthusiasts faced the following challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disorganized Movie Recommendations:</strong> Users needed a better way to find and store their favorite movies in a list they can refer back to.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of User-Centric Features:</strong> Many platforms didn’t provide a personalized experience to save and manage favorite movies.</li>
                <li><strong>Complex User Authentication:</strong> Logging into platforms and managing user data was often confusing and time-consuming.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Movie Management:</strong> A personalized favorite movie list, where users can add and remove movies based on their interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Seamless Authentication:</strong> Secure login process that uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for user sessions.</li>
            </ul>
